        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Rigging is everything on a sailboat. It factors into the performance of the boat as well as conformability. In my discussions with the previous owner, I was pleased to learn that the standing rigging had been replaced recently along with a few pieces of running rigging such as the mainsheet and halyards. Despite this, there was still much to address in regard to rigging.</p>
        <h3>Headsail Downhaul/Spinnaker Tack-Line</h3>
        <p>Inspired by <a class='emailLink' style='font-weight:200' target='none' href='https://stingysailor.com/2023/03/25/headsail-downhaul-solution-2/'><u>The Stingy Sailor</u></a>, my first addition to the rigging of this boat was a double-duty headsail downhaul (white line with red tracer below).</p>
        <img style='margin-bottom:20px; border-radius:5px; width:60%; max-width:600px; height:auto;' src='../ProjectPics/bowPic.jpg'>
        <h4>Outline</h4>
        <p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>The purpose of this line is to allow a jib/genoa to be pulled down from the cockpit. This is helpful in a couple of ways:</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Easier singlehand sailing</li>
            <li>Crew does not have to go forward to reduce sail (especially handy in heavy conditions)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to these benefits as a downhaul, the system can work as an adjustable tack-line for a spinnaker sail.</p>
        <h4>Function</h4>
        <p>The downhaul is run through a turning block shackled to the stem fitting and the lead aft to the cockpit through fairleads, where it terminates in a jam cleat.</p>
        <p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>To douse a sail with the downhaul...</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Turn the bow into the wind</li>
            <li>Release the headsail halyard</li>
            <li>Keeping slight tension on the halyard, pull the downhaul through the cleat</li>
            <li>When conditions allow, contain/stow the headsail</li>
        </ul>
        <p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>To hoist a sail with the downhaul...</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Turn the bow into the wind</li>
            <li>Coil the downhaul such that it can feed through its cleat</li>
            <li>Uncleat the downhaul</li>
            <li>Hoist the headsail with the halyard as usual</li>
            <li>Take most of the slack out of downhaul; do not pull tight</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Future Improvements</h4>
        <p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>After using this system many times, there are a few improvements to be made:</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Relocate turning block to reduce clutter and allow for Catalina Direct Anchor Roller</li>
            <li>Replace jam cleat with a cam cleat to make hosting easier</li>
            <li>Add a fairlead to reduce gelcoat wear at a specific point</li>
        </ul>
