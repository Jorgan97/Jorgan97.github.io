        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class='viewerBody'>After sailing home, one of the most glaring issues with the boat was the electrical system. The less than stellar design of the system from the factory combined with years of patchwork by multiple owners left a recipe for disaster.</p>
        <p class='viewerBody'>Fortunately, I love doing 12 Volt electrical work, so this was a great first step to take on in the restoration of my Catalina 22.</p>
        <h3>Initial Problems</h3>
        <p class='viewerBody'>There were several issues with the electrical system upon acquisition of the boat:</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li><b>Open wiring</b> - Wires (possibly powered) not connected to anything can lead to shorts and fires</li>
            <li><b>Wire nuts</b> - Unacceptable in a marine environment due to the lack of corrosion protection and general impermanence</li>
            <li><b>General Disorganization</b> - Makes maintenance and troubleshooting difficult</li>
            <li><b>Components not connected</b> - Several components such as cabin lights, the anchor light, and compass backlight not connected to the system</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>New System Design</h3>
        <p class='viewerBody' style='margin-bottom:5px'>A diagram of the new electrical system is shown and discussed below.</p>
        <h4 style='margin-bottom:5px'><b>Key Points</b></h4>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Power for each component originates at the Main Fuse Panel such that the entire system is fused</li>
            <li>The bilge pump and radio memory have power regardless of the position of the main power switch on the Main Switch Panel</li>
            <li>Each component off of the Main Switch Panel is fused again. This is also true true with the subsequent Mast Lights Switch Panel</li>
            <li>Each component grounds to the ground bus bar which is connected directly to the battery</li>
            <li>Not shown is a removable small trickle charging solar panel</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p class='viewerBody' style='margin-bottom:5px;'>The primary goals of building this system were to ensure that it is safe and reliable. To obtain this, the following guidelines were used.</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Oversized wires used relative to fuses and devices.</li>
            <li>Each connection is crimped and protected with heat shrink<br>(some have double heat shrink because most of the crimp connectors used have a heat shrink coating)</li>
            <li>Very small gauge wire is soldered instead of crimped (rare)</li>
            <li>Wires are kept as high as possible within the space they are located</li>
            <li>Follow <a href='https://www.clrmarine.com/538.html?srsltid=AfmBOorpWszdiiaz7wocrYct_JglKHNQBu24bhia4mi_0Fv9fLjz0YIx' target='none' class='emailLink' style='font-weight:200;'><u>ABYC wire-color standards</u></a> where practical</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p class='viewerBody' style='margin-bottom:5px'>Two primary challenges were presented during this implementation:</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>
                The boat was not designed or constructed with modern wiring standards/practices in consideration. For example:
                <ul class='projectUl'>
                    <li>Wire-runs sandwiched between fiberglass components are impossible to maintain or replace</li>
                    <li>General lack of built in wire conduit and organization devices</li>
                    <li>No existing system for fusing devices receiving constant power</li>
                    <li>Not enough switches to control necessary navigational lighting</li>
                    <li>No allocated space to implement the aforementioned systems</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It is financially impractical to completely replace each length of wire and component</li>
        </ul>
        <p class='viewerBody' style='margin-bottom:5px'>Overcoming these challenges required compromises in the aesthetics and organization of the system, but also clever solutions. For example:</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Wire lengths result in unsightly routes away from fuse panels and the bus bar</li>
            <li>Separate locations of the fuse panel board and switch panel result in complicated wire routes</li>
            <li>A backing board for mounting the fuse panels was installed using 3M 4200 semi-permanent marine adhesive. Modern vessels likely have something similar already installed made from PVC board or a glassed in wooden backer board</li>
            <li>A separate temporary mast light switch panel for use until further improvements can be made</li>
        </ul>

            <img src='../projectPics/wire1.jpg' class='projectPic'>
            <p class='viewerCaption'>Fuse board with the Accessory Fuse Panel on top, Main Fuse Panel in the middle, and Ground Bus Bar on the bottom.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='imagePlusCaption'>
            <img src='../projectPics/mastSwitch.jpg' class='projectPic' style='height:200px; width:auto;'>
            <p class='viewerCaption'>Mast Lights Switch Panel with switches for the anchor light, deck light, and steaming light in order from left to right.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p class='viewerBody' style='margin-bottom: 5px'>In its current state the system works well; however, I would like to make improvements in the near future.</p>
        <ul class='projectUl'>
            <li>Addition of VHF radio, likely built into a panel with mast light switches and USB charging ports</li>
            <li>Reorganize how wires are zip-tied together</li>
            <li>Connect a spare cabin light that the previous owner left</li>
            <li>Clean/refresh the on/off indicators on the Main Switch Panel</li>
        </ul>
