        My first car was a 2001 Mazda Miata, a little convertible I happily drove around for a few years. Its novelty outweighed its drawbacks for a time; however, eventually I found myself in need of something more practical. Late in the summer of 2022, in a search for a vehicle more closely matching my lifestyle, I purchased a stock 2008 Toyota 4Runner 4WD SR5 4.0L V6 in Shadow Mica Grey.

        Even stock, this mid-sized SUV carried a "get it done" attitude that I loved. Being four-wheel-drive, the 4Runner is capable of adventures in a multitude of environments ranging from the soft sands of the Outer Banks to the rocky trails of who-knows-where. With that said, the 4Runner is still a sort of "family-car" so it needed some modification to match the functionality and style I was after. This also presented a chance to practice some engineering skills.
