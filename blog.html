                        <p style='margin-bottom:5px;'><i>January 1, 2025</i></p>
                        <h3>Mainsail Control Lines</h3>
                        <p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>On my sailboat, some of mainsail controls were permanently applied or completely absent including...</p>
                        <ul class='projectUl'>
                            <li>Outhaul</li>
                            <li>Downhaul</li>
                            <li>Reefing line(s)</li>
                            <li>Traveler controls</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Over the course of the first few months with the boat, I have replaced the control lines for each of these systems; however only the traveler is complete by nature of only being lines.</p>
                        <p>The other controls are waiting on the hardware and time necessary to finish up. For example, the outhaul is functional, but it is cleated using a horn cleat when it would be more effectively held with a cam or jam cleat. Similarly, the reefing line and downhaul are cleated to the old halyard cleats on the mast.</p>
                        <h3>Halyards</h3>
                        <p style='margin-bottom:5px;'>The halyards on my boat have been frustrating from the beginning because they are <i>so</i> close to being setup well. The few issues I have include:</p>
                        <ul class="projectUl">
                            <li>Only two turning blocks for the three halyards</li>
                            <li>Cracked turning block sheaves</li>
                            <li>Line jammers unable to maintain tension</li>
                            <li>General lack of lubrication/cleaning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once again, the dilemma with replacing the halyard systems has been a lack of hardware and time. That said, I have a plan for how I want everything to work and go together.</p>
                        <p>As the boat stands, each system (sail controls, halyards, etc), is functional, but not where I want it to be for everyday use. Luckily, I was fortunate to receive much of the needed hardware as gifts for this year's Christmas. So with hardware acquired, I only have to wait for when I am back home from school this spring to have time to work.</p>
